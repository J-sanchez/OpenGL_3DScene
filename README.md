## How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software begings with an IDEA. Whether that be my own or a customers. I then begin to understand the IDEA by collecting requirements and discussing the end goal. Once I have collected requirements I begin to research similar projects and sketch out process flows, the overall design and make notes of what I think are potential risks. Lastly, I always make itterations based on feedback or my perceptions.
